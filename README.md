# banana-themes

A set of themes for pygments made by the 8Banana team and friends!

# Installation

There are two ways to go about this.

## Pip-managed cloning

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/8Banana/banana-themes.git
```

This solution is simplier, and allows you to update the themes by just running
that command again with `--upgrade`.

It is reccommended you use this method.

## Manual cloning

```bash
git clone https://github.com/8Banana/banana-themes
cd banana-themes
python3 -m pip install --user .
```

This solution is a bit longer but allows you to hack & slash the source.
